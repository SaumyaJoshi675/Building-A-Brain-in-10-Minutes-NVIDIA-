# 🧠 Neural Network in 10 Minutes

This repository contains my implementation of the **NVIDIA DLI course: "Building a Neural Network in 10 Minutes"**.  
The notebook/code walks through building, training, and evaluating a simple neural network using modern deep learning tools.

---

## 📌 Overview
In this project, I:
- Implemented a **basic feed-forward neural network** from scratch using Python.
- Learned how to design layers, activation functions, and loss functions.
- Trained the network on a simple dataset to demonstrate classification.
- Evaluated the model’s performance and visualized the results.

This exercise provided me with a hands-on introduction to **deep learning fundamentals** and how neural networks learn from data.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (depending on your code version)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running interactively)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(or install individually as needed)*

## 🚀 Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. Run the script or open the notebook:
   ```bash
   python neural_network.py
   ```
   or  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook neural_network.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow along with the steps to build and train the network.

## 📊 Results

- The neural network successfully learned to classify the dataset.
- Accuracy improved with training epochs.
- Visualization shows how the decision boundaries evolve as the model trains.

*(You can add training plots, accuracy curves, or screenshots here if available.)*
